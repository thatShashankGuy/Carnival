Carnival Project - by thatShashankGuy

uses the power of Fetch Api to pull data and render over a Single Page application buit in React JS

I buit this project ot create a simele React UI, use an external API to fetch data and explore Promises.

The UI uses Particle JS and Material UI to look more dynamic. This is just the inital built and with constant update new features will be added .
